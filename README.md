GPT Study is a groundbreaking web app that revolutionizes the way students study â€“ akin to Quizlet but with a remarkable twist.  

This innovative platform empowers users to effortlessly create comprehensive study sets with cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology.  

Once a user uploads a set of example questions, the AI algorithm springs into action, generating an array of additional questions based on the provided examples. This dynamic feature supercharges the study experience, offering users a vast repertoire of diverse and challenging questions to master.  

The study sets are then saved to users accounts allowing them to access their materials from anywhere and at anytime!
